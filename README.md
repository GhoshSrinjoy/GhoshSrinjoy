## 📊 Academic Projects

- **Master's Thesis: RAG to RICHES - Multimodal Cross-Lingual RAG System**:
  - Designed and implemented **RICHES** (RAG with Intelligent Cross-Document Clustering and Hybrid Ensemble Search), a novel self-hosted multilingual **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** system for secure document processing across English and German.
  - Developed a novel **multimodal PDF parser** achieving state-of-the-art extraction of text, tables, images, and mathematical equations using layout detection (DETR) and specialized OCR, operating entirely locally without VLM dependencies.
  - Engineered a **three-pipeline architecture** (Ingestor, Retriever, Generator) with progressive multi-strategy retrieval: Simple Search for factual queries, Chain-of-Thought for comparative analysis, and Agentic Planning for complex multi-step inquiries.
  - Implemented **ingestion-time K-Means clustering** with Elbow Method optimization, transforming brute-force search into efficient two-stage lookup (cluster centroid → members), drastically reducing query latency while maintaining accuracy.
  - Achieved **93.7% completion rate** vs. 30% for OpenAI Playground on heterogeneous benchmarks, processing 100 files across PDFs, DOCX, images, and structured data with specialized parsers within **24GB VRAM** constraint.
  - Built **hybrid parallel retrieval** combining vector search, BM25 lexical search, SQL metadata search, and image similarity using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), with language-consistent generation and inline citation traceability.
  - Processed complete ingestion pipeline in **10m 46s** with predictable cost distribution and sub-minute query response times, demonstrating 3.1× better search accuracy than commercial alternatives.

- **Workflow Automation using LLMs**:
  - Developed a system to accurately analyze text from emails and user conversations to extract project descriptions and deploy it in Argo Workflow.
  - Automated the deployment of workflows in **Argo** by generating YAML files using **GPT-3.5 Turbo** integrated with a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline.
  - Designed a user-friendly interface with **Chainlit** for seamless user interaction.

- **Deploying ML Models on FPGA**:
  - Explored **model quantization** and optimization techniques to deploy advanced ML models such as **BERT** and **YOLOv3** on the **Xilinx Kria KV260 Vision AI Starter Kit**.
  - Addressed challenges related to FPGA hardware constraints and toolchain compatibility.
  - Leveraged **Vitis AI** for efficient model deployment.

- **Knowledge Graph Website for Architects and Planners**:
  - Extracted and preprocessed text from PDFs to identify latent topics and related keywords.
  - Built a graph database, enabling visualization and querying of relationships between themes and keywords in sustainable architectural planning.

- **Voice Assistant for the Visually Impaired**:
  - Created a voice-controlled assistant using **VOSK** speech recognition and **pyttsx3** text-to-speech for enhanced accessibility.
  - Enabled features like retrieving time, date, location, and system commands, such as shutdown, tailored to improve user productivity.

- **Smart Lock Using Facial Recognition**:
  - Built a smart lock system with **Raspberry Pi**, to identify and authenticate faces.
  - Successfully integrated a magnetic lock for automated access control.

- **Sound Mixer Using Arduino**:
  - Programmed a sound mixer using **Arduino UNO** and piezo buzzers to reproduce music, including **Metallica's "Enter Sandman"**.
  - Customized sound effects with the **NOTE** library.
