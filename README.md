  - Automated the deployment of workflows in **Argo** by generating YAML files using **GPT-3.5 Turbo** integrated with a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline.
  - Designed a user-friendly interface with **Chainlit** for seamless user interaction.

- **Deploying ML Models on FPGA**:
  - Explored **model quantization** and optimization techniques to deploy advanced ML models such as **BERT** and **YOLOv3** on the **Xilinx Kria KV260 Vision AI Starter Kit**.
  - Addressed challenges related to FPGA hardware constraints and toolchain compatibility.
  - Leveraged **Vitis AI** for efficient model deployment.

- **Knowledge Graph Website for Architects and Planners**:
  - Extracted and preprocessed text from PDFs to identify latent topics and related keywords.
  - Built a graph database, enabling visualization and querying of relationships between themes and keywords in sustainable architectural planning.

- **Voice Assistant for the Visually Impaired**:
  - Created a voice-controlled assistant using **VOSK** speech recognition and **pyttsx3** text-to-speech for enhanced accessibility.
  - Enabled features like retrieving time, date, location, and system commands, such as shutdown, tailored to improve user productivity.

- **Smart Lock Using Facial Recognition**:
  - Built a smart lock system with **Raspberry Pi**, to identify and authenticate faces.
